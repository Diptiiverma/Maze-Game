# Maze-Game
Guide the KEY 🔑 to its HOUSE 🏠 using a recursive backtracking algorithm. Interactive maze visualization with custom walls, start/end points, and animated pathfinding!"

The "Rat in a Maze" problem is a classic maze-solving puzzle.
In this project, the goal is to help the KEY 🔑 reach its HOUSE 🏠 while avoiding walls and obstacles 🚧.
This is a JavaScript-based implementation using Recursion and Backtracking, visualized with CSS animations for a fun, interactive experience!

✨ Features
★ Interactive Maze Visualization: See the maze and solution in real-time.
★ Recursive & Backtracking Algorithm: Smart algorithm finds the path efficiently.
★ Animated Pathfinding: Watch the KEY 🔑 move towards its HOUSE 🏠 step by step.
★ Start & End Point Selection: Customize where the KEY begins and ends.
★ Wall Placement: Create your own obstacles and test different maze layouts.
★ Try Again Button: Restart the maze anytime to challenge yourself! 🔄

🧩 Algorithm Overview
The maze is solved using a Recursive Backtracking Algorithm:
★ Step 1: Check if the current position is the destination 🏠.
★ Step 2: If not, verify if the move is valid (within boundaries and not a wall 🚧).
★ Step 3: If valid, mark the cell as part of the solution path and explore adjacent cells recursively.
★ Step 4: If no valid move is found, backtrack 🔙 and try another path.

Repeat until the KEY reaches the HOUSE or all possibilities are explored.
